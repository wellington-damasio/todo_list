# Todo List
## About the project
This is a challenge from the first chapter of Rocketseat's Ignite classes.

Users should be able to:
- See their taks, and if they are done or not
- Add new tasks
- Delete specific tasks

## Things I want to add to this project
The best way to learn is to make projects yourself (as I'm doing now ðŸ™ƒ) and to try to add cool features to those projects.

Some features I want to add are:
- Tasks go to the bottom of the list when completed
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Hide tasks that are already done
